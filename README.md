# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their behavioral and demographic characteristics. Customer segmentation is a fundamental task in marketing analytics, enabling businesses to target different customer groups more effectively.

## 📊 Overview

The notebook explores a dataset that contains information such as:
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Age
- Gender

By applying the K-Means clustering algorithm, the notebook identifies distinct customer segments based on their spending behavior and income levels.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
- Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- K-Means Clustering for segmentation
- Cluster visualization using scatter plots

## 📁 Files
